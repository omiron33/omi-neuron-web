# Task 4P.3: Interaction + Animation Storyboard

## Objective
Define the animation and interaction sequences that make the visualization feel alive.

## Requirements
- Storyboard idle animations (node drift, pulse, edge flow).
- Storyboard hover behavior (highlight, card appear, edge emphasis).
- Storyboard click/focus sequence (ripple, camera tween, selection glow).
- Define transition behaviors for filtering and visibility changes.

## Deliverables
- `docs/visualization/animation-storyboard.md` with sequences and timing notes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each interaction state has a defined visual response.
- [ ] Timing/easing guidance is included for core sequences.
- [ ] Storyboard covers idle, hover, click, and filter transitions.
